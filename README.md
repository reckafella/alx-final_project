# ALX Weather API

This is the primary repository for the ALX  Weather API, a free and open API designed to serve weather forecast data using the same syntax as Dark Sky. 


## Why

Weather forecasts are produced by government agencies using computational models; however, the data is hard to work with. Instead, there are a bunch of companies that take this data, process it, and provide easier to work with APIs. However, the steps that the data goes through aren't public or documented (for example, what do they mean by "percent of precipitation"?!?). I put this service together in order to provide a better way for people to know where their weather data is coming from and how it is being processed!
